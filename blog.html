          <hr>
          <p>I've decided to start this blog section to help motivate others that might be considering a career change, or just picking up
          a new hobby. I decided to learn web develpment to change my career path. I have a background in IT. At first I thought it was what
          I'd like to do for a few years. To keep it short I went from a very technical role to providing end user support and strayed off the path I had set
          for myself which was focused on networking and aimed towards obtaining multiple Cisco certifications.</p>
        <p>My role providing end user support was very rewarding but I was becoming frustrated, started needing an outlet to let out work induced stress.
        At times I really loved & enjoyed what I was doing for a living but the need for a change was evident and programming was always an interest of mine that
      I was simply too afraid to dive into because of the lack of knowledge of where or how to start. </p>
        <h2 class="entergoogle">Enter Google</h2>
        <p>All the information you need to get started is on the internet. Your requirements: a computer, internet connection, & the ability to Google. A well phrased search
          can & will help you way more than you can imagine. I suggest searching for things like "becoming a web developer", or "becoming a programmer". There will be plenty of information
          to help you learn the differences between web developers(front end & back end), iOS & Android developers, & software engineers. You will also find forums with advice on what path is suggested you take depending
          on what type of developer you decide to become. You might be wondering, <a target="blank"href="https://www.quora.com/Do-expert-programmers-use-Google-frequently-when-coding"id="qoura1">"Do expert programmers use Google frequently when
          coding?"</a> Short answer is yes, & more frequently than you might think. I thought that having up to 15-20 tabs (almost all Google searches) open at once was just a result
        of me being a beginner, but the more exeperienced web developers and programmers I've networked with always suggested the use of Google and we almost always laughed at me thinking that 15-20 tabs open at once was something not common. I was quite accustomed to Googling and little that I knew it's very valuable.
      Google will prove to be one of your best friends as you become a developer, programmer or designer, but be mindful of how you phrase your searches as they can also return results that might not be of much help at all.</p>
        <h2 class="entergoogle">Valuable Resources.</h2>
        <p>Below I have listed some of the online learning resources which I find to be extremely valuable & which I have had a chance to try:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stories" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp (Free. Able to work on non-profit projects once youâ€™ve earned your Front End Development, Data Visualization, and Back End Development certifications.)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/stories" target="_blank">Team Treehouse(paid. $25/mo or $199 Techdegree )</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy(sometimes on sale for as little as $10)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. A Havard Univeristy course taught by David J. Malan</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity (paid. $199-$299 Nanodegree)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity (paid. $199-$299 Nanodegree)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy (free & paid)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-community-bootcamp/">Flatiron School Community-Powered Bootcamp (currently what I am using and I really like it. Check site for pricing.)</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of the resources are paid which have laid out paths for you to follow upon choosing what type of developer you would like to become. The Mozilla Developer Network and Stack Overflow are essential to your learning. They have so much information that will prove valuable.
        </p>
        <p>Beginner Books I recommend for web development:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="resources"><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do">Head First HTML & CSS By Elisabeth Robson, Eric Freeman</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites By Jon Duckett</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="http://javascriptbook.com/">JavaScript & JQuery By Jon Duckett</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript By Marijn Haverbeke</a></li>
          <li class="resources"><a href="  https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way By Zed Shaw</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are just some of the resources which I've had the time to use or check out in my learning process so far. I would suggest taking a look at each of the Online learning resources and once you've decided a path then start reading the books which cover topics on the subject that
        your selected path requires you to learn. Again these resoruces are some that I have used on my path to becoming a web developer but some like Stack Overflow and Team Treehouse can help you educate yourself in becoming a different type of developer depending on what you are interested in.
      There also other options such as bootcamps, some which require some programming knowledge and also come along with a pretty hefty price tag.</p>
        <p>Don't be scared to answer questions. Asking questions will be a major key in your success, do not be scared to "sound dumb". We ask questions because we do not understand something and sometimes someone might be able to explain it in a way which allows us to grasp the concept in question clearly.
        I will updates this blog as I go, I will post my experiences with additional resources I use such as my favorite text editor and what my learning is currently covering. Feel free to stop by! I hope this helps someone at least a bit, once you dive into it and start making progress you'll be glad you decided to
      follow your desire to become a web developer or programmer. </p>
